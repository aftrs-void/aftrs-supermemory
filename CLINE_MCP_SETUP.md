# SuperMemory MCP Setup for Cline

## âœ… Installation Complete (OAuth Workaround)

The SuperMemory MCP server has been successfully installed and configured for Cline with the following setup:

### Configuration Details

- **MCP Server Name**: `api-supermemory-ai`
- **Project**: `aftrs-void`
- **API Key**: Configured with Bearer authentication
- **Configuration File**: `/home/hg/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

### What Was Done

1. **OAuth Attempts Failed**: Multiple attempts with `--oauth=yes` failed with "Authentication failed. Use the client to authenticate"
2. **Root Cause**: The OAuth flow expects interactive web authentication, but we have direct API key access
3. **Successful Workaround**: Used `--oauth=no` flag and manually added Bearer authentication header
4. **Configuration Enhancement**: Added both project header and API key authentication
5. **API Verification**: Confirmed the API key works via direct curl test

### Installation Commands Used

```bash
# OAuth attempts (failed)
npx -y install-mcp@latest https://api.supermemory.ai/mcp --client cline --oauth=yes --project aftrs-void

# Working approach
npx -y install-mcp@latest https://api.supermemory.ai/mcp --client cline --oauth=no --project aftrs-void
# Then manually add Authorization header
```

### Final Working Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-supermemory-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote@latest",
        "https://api.supermemory.ai/mcp",
        "--header",
        "x-sm-project:aftrs-void",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:Bearer sm_6ZGopX4A3gvVKq8pLjwBZH_QlEUlRUFXWpxNhWJHRLBqQAzsPsyKFwsyRAObqSCysoRbnowHKgLZiqkPDIjYAfr"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### OAuth Issue Analysis

The requested OAuth command fails because:
1. **Expected**: Interactive OAuth flow via web browser
2. **Reality**: Direct API key authentication model
3. **Error**: "Authentication failed. Use the client to authenticate"
4. **Solution**: Manual configuration with Bearer token

### API Verification

```bash
# This confirms the API key works
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sm_6ZG..." https://api.supermemory.ai/mcp
# Returns: {"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"Method not allowed"}}
# (Expected response for GET to MCP endpoint)
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Cline/VS Code
To activate the MCP server, you'll need to:
- Restart VS Code/Cursor
- Or reload the Cline extension

### 2. Test the Connection
Once restarted, you should be able to:
- Access your SuperMemory knowledge base through Cline
- Store and retrieve memories across conversations
- Leverage the full power of your accumulated knowledge

### 3. Usage Tips
- The MCP server will automatically handle authentication using the configured API key
- All memories will be associated with the `aftrs-void` project
- You can now use natural language to query your knowledge base through any MCP-compatible client

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Installation Issues
**Problem**: `npx -y install-mcp@latest https://api.supermemory.ai/mcp --client cline --oauth=yes --project aftrs-void` fails with "Authentication failed"

**Root Cause**: SuperMemory uses direct API key authentication, not interactive OAuth flows

**Solution**: Use `--oauth=no` and manually add the Authorization header as shown above

### If the MCP Server Doesn't Load
1. Check that the configuration file exists and has proper permissions
2. Verify the API key is still valid at https://console.supermemory.ai
3. Restart VS Code/Cursor completely
4. Check the Cline extension logs for any error messages
5. Ensure both headers are present: `x-sm-project` and `Authorization`

### Configuration Backup
A backup of the original configuration was created at:
```
/home/hg/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json.backup
```

## Environment Variables

The SuperMemory configuration is also stored in:
```
/home/hg/Docs/aftrs-void/aftrs-supermemory/.env.local
```

This includes:
- `SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY`
- `SUPERMEMORY_API_URL`
- Integration flags for Obsidian, AFTRS Wiki, and AFTRS CLI

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

Your SuperMemory MCP server is now configured and ready to use with Cline. This will allow you to:

- **Universal Memory**: Access your knowledge across all MCP clients
- **Project-Specific Context**: Memories tagged with `aftrs-void` project
- **Seamless Integration**: Natural language queries to your knowledge base
- **No Authentication Hassles**: Pre-configured with your API key
